# DPFEHM: A Differentiable Subsurface Flow Simulator

## Description

DPFEHM is a [Julia](http://julialang.org/) module that includes differentiable numerical models with a focus on fluid flow and transport in the Earth's subsurface. Currently it supports the groundwater flow equations (single phase flow), Richards equation (air/water), the advection-dispersion equation, and the 2d wave equation.

## Basic Usage

The [examples](https://github.com/OrchardLANL/DPFEHM.jl/tree/master/examples) are a good place to get started to see how to use DPFEHM. Two examples will be described in detail here that illustrate the basic usage patterns via an examples of steady-state single-phase flow and transient Richards equation.

### [Steady-state single-phase flow](https://github.com/OrchardLANL/DPFEHM.jl/blob/master/examples/gw_steadystate_3d/inputdeck.jl)
Here, we solve a steady-state single phase flow problem . Let's start by importing several libraries that we will use.

```julia
import DPFEHM
import GaussianRandomFields
import Optim
import PyPlot
import Random
import Zygote
Random.seed!(0)#set the seed so we can reproduce the same results with each run
```

Next, we'll set up the grid. Here, we use a regular grid with 100,000 nodes that covers a domain that is 50 meters by 50 meters by 5 meters.
```julia
mins = [0, 0, 0]; maxs = [50, 50, 5]#size of the domain, in meters
ns = [100, 100, 10]#number of nodes on the grid
coords, neighbors, areasoverlengths, _ = DPFEHM.regulargrid3d(mins, maxs, ns)#build the grid
```
The result of this grid-building is three variables that we will use. The, `coords` is a matrix describing the coordinates of the cell centers on the grid. The second, `neighbors`, is an array describing which cells neighbor other cells. The third, `areasoverlengths`, is another array whose length is equal to the length of `neighbors` and describes the area of the interface between two neighboring cells dividing by the length between the cell centers. The last variable is dumped to `_` and gives the volumes of the cells. The volumes of the cells are not needed for steady state problems, so they are not used in this example.

Now we set up the boundary conditions.
```julia
Qs = zeros(size(coords, 2))
injectionnode = 1#inject in the lower left corner
Qs[injectionnode] = 1e-4#m^3/s
dirichletnodes = Int[size(coords, 2)]#fix the pressure in the upper right corner
dirichleths = zeros(size(coords, 2))
dirichleths[size(coords, 2)] = 0.0
```
The variable `Qs` describes fluid sources/sinks -- the amount of fluid injected at cell `i` on the grid is given by `Qs[i]`. In this example, the only place were we inject fluid is at node 1. Another variable, `dirichletnodes` is a list of cells at which the pressure will be fixed. In this example, the pressure is fixed at the last cell, which is cell number `size(coords, 2)`. The variable `dirichleths` describes the pressures (or heads in hydrology jargon) that the cells are fixed at. Note that the length of `dirichleths` is `size(coords, 2)`, but these values are ignored except at the indices that appear in `dirichletnodes`.


The final set-up step before moving on to solving the equations is to construct a heterogeneous conductivity field.
Here, we use the package `GaussianRandomFields` to construct a conductivity field with a correlation length of 50 meters. The mean of the log-conductivity is `1e-4`meters/second (note that we use a natural logarithm when defining this), and the standard deviation of the log-conductivity is 1. `GaussianRandomFields` is used to construct a field in 2 dimensions and then it is copied through each of the layers, so that the heterogeneity only exists in the x and y coordinate directions, but not in the z direction.
```julia
lambda = 50.0#meters -- correlation length of log-conductivity
sigma = 1.0#standard deviation of log-conductivity
mu = -9.0#mean of log conductivity -- ~1e-4 m/s, like clean sand here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_conductivity#/media/File:Groundwater_Freeze_and_Cherry_1979_Table_2-2.png
cov = GaussianRandomFields.CovarianceFunction(2, GaussianRandomFields.Matern(lambda, 1; Ïƒ=sigma))
x_pts = range(mins[1], maxs[1]; length=ns[1])
y_pts = range(mins[2], maxs[2]; length=ns[2])
num_eigenvectors = 200
grf = GaussianRandomFields.GaussianRandomField(cov, GaussianRandomFields.KarhunenLoeve(num_eigenvectors), x_pts, y_pts)
logKs = zeros(reverse(ns)...)
logKs2d = mu .+ GaussianRandomFields.sample(grf)'#generate a random realization of the log-conductivity field
for i = 1:ns[3]#copy the 2d field to each of the 3d layers
	v = view(logKs, i, :, :)
	v .= logKs2d
end
```
The conductivity field is shown:

![Conductivity field](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OrchardLANL/DPFEHM.jl/master/
/gw_steadystate_3d/conductivity.png)
<!--
#plot the log-conductivity
fig, ax = PyPlot.subplots()
img = ax.imshow(logKs[1, :, :], origin="lower")
ax.title.set_text("Conductivity Field")
fig.colorbar(img)
display(fig)
println()
PyPlot.close(fig)
-->

Now, we look to solve the flow problem. First, we define a helper function, `logKs2Ks_neighbors`. This function is needed because the flow solver wants to know the conductivity on the interface between two cells, but our previous construction defined the conductivities at the cells themselves. It also converts from log-conductivity to conductivity and uses the geometric mean to move from the cells to the interfaces. The heart of this code is the call to `DPFEHM.groundwater_steadystate`, which solves the single phase steady-state flow problem that we pose. The `solveforh` function calls this function and returns the result after reshaping.
```julia
logKs2Ks_neighbors(Ks) = exp.(0.5 * (Ks[map(p->p[1], neighbors)] .+ Ks[map(p->p[2], neighbors)]))#convert from permeabilities at the nodes to permeabilities connecting the nodes
function solveforh(logKs, dirichleths)
	@assert length(logKs) == length(Qs)
	Ks_neighbors = logKs2Ks_neighbors(logKs)
	return reshape(DPFEHM.groundwater_steadystate(Ks_neighbors, neighbors, areasoverlengths, dirichletnodes, dirichleths, Qs), reverse(ns)...)
	end
end
```

With this function in hand, we can solve the problem using the `solveforh` wrapper function we previously defined. This function requires us to explicitly pass in `logKs` (the hydraulic conductivity) and `dirichleths` (the fixed-head boundary condition), but the other inputs to `DPFEHM.groundwater_steadystate` are fixed to global values.
```julia
h = solveforh(logKs, dirichleths)#solve for the head
```
The head at the bottom layer of the domain is shown (note the pressure is higher in the lower corner, where there is fluid injection, than in the rest of the domain):

![Head field](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OrchardLANL/DPFEHM.jl/master/examples/gw_steadystate_3d/head.png)
<!--
#plot the head at the bottom of the domain
fig, ax = PyPlot.subplots()
img = ax.imshow(h[1, :, :], origin="lower")
ax.title.set_text("Head")
fig.colorbar(img)
display(fig)
println()
PyPlot.close(fig)
-->

DPFEHM also allows us to compute the gradient of functions involving `DPFEHM.groundwater_steadystate` using `Zygote.gradient` or `Zygote.pullback`.
```julia
isfreenode, nodei2freenodei, freenodei2nodei = DPFEHM.getfreenodes(length(dirichleths), dirichletnodes)
gradient_node = nodei2freenodei[div(size(coords, 2), 2) + 500]
gradient_node_x = coords[1, gradient_node]
gradient_node_y = coords[2, gradient_node]
grad = Zygote.gradient((x, y)->solveforh(x, y)[gradient_node], logKs, dirichleths)#calculate the gradient (which involves a redundant calculation of the forward pass)
function_evaluation, back = Zygote.pullback((x, y)->solveforh(x, y)[gradient_node], logKs, dirichleths)#this pullback thing lets us not redo the forward pass
print("gradient time")
grad2 = back(1.0)#compute the gradient of a function involving solveforh using Zygote.pullback
```
Note that the function `DPFEHM.getfreenodes` allows one to map indices between the free nodes (i.e., the ones that do not have fixed-pressure boundary conditions) and all nodes. The gradient of `logK` at the bottom layer of the domain is shown:

![Gradient field](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OrchardLANL/DPFEHM.jl/master/examples/gw_steadystate_3d/gradient.png)
<!--
#plot the gradient of the function w.r.t. the logK at the bottom of the domain
fig, ax = PyPlot.subplots()
img = ax.imshow(grad[1][1, :, :], origin="lower", extent=[mins[1], maxs[1], mins[2], maxs[2]])
ax.plot([gradient_node_x], [gradient_node_y], "r.", ms=10, alpha=0.5)
ax.title.set_text("Gradient of head at dot w.r.t. logK at bottom of domain")
fig.colorbar(img)
display(fig)
println()
PyPlot.close(fig)
-->
