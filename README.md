DPFEHM: A Differentiable Subsurface Flow Simulator
===============================

Description
-----------

DPFEHM is a [Julia](http://julialang.org/) module that includes differentiable numerical models for fluid flows in the Earth's subsurface. Currently it supports single phase flow and limited two-phase flow via the Richards equation.

The [examples](https://github.com/OrchardLANL/DPFEHM.jl/tree/master/examples) are a good place to get started to see how to use DPFEHM.
